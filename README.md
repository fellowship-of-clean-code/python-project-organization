# Python project organization

How to manage a python project once we have more than a
few files. 

Topics:

- dependency management
- [module & folder structure](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/#modules)
- integrating scripts & notebooks
- class structure
    - when to use classes
    - DRY principle
    - "The first rule of classes is that they should be small. The second rule of classes is that 
    they should be smaller than that."
    - "We should also be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25 words,
    without using the words “if,” “and,” “or,” or “but.”"
    - "The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have one,
    and only one, reason to change."
